# Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Bikeshare Project!

This repo contains my code submitted for the Bikeshare Project for the python portion of this Udacity Nanodegree.

This particular file will include any additional documentation necessary to explain the relevance of files in this repo, explain how the code functions, and address any updates or bug fixes for the code.

##Dependencies

To run this program you will need to have the following packages installed:

    - pandas
    - numpy
    - datetime
    - time
    - calendar

Use the package manager to install these packages if you do not already have them installed. Example below:

'''bash
pip install pandas
'''

##Usage

python bikeshare.py

From there simply follow the input prompts.

##Files Included

In addition to the bikeshare.py program, you will also find the following csv datafiles:

    - new_york_city.csv
    - chicago.csv
    - washington.csv

Without these files there is no data for this program to use!

##Credits

This program was written using a Udacity outline for the bikeshare project, but many different resources were used in the trial and error process of creating a fully functioning program. This Stackoverflow discussion was particularly useful in creating the while expressions for user input (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23294658/asking-the-user-for-input-until-they-give-a-valid-response)
